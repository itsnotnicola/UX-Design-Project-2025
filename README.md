# UX Design Project 2025

## Overview
This repository showcases the complete UX/UI design process for a digital restaurant management system. 

## Project Components
The design process involved the following stages:
- **Analysis and Research**: Understanding user needs and system requirements and conducting a competitive analysis..
- **Design**: Creating wireframes and visual designs.
- **Prototyping**: Developing interactive prototypes for user testing.
- **Evaluation**: Gathering feedback to iterate on designs.

## Documentation
All relevant documentation and the final prototype are included in this repository. Please explore the directories for detailed insights into each phase of the project. Each assignment was developed with significant time constraints, as roughly 5 days was given for each submission.

### Brief 1
